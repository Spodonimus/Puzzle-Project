# Puzzle-Project
Three puzzles for the user to solve using AWT/SWING technologies. Includes an automatic solve option

I built this project using NetBeans. To run the full GUI interface, navigate to 
C:\Users\Andrew\Documents\GitHub\Puzzle-Project\CS_2511_Solve\src\framework\Test and run TestFrame.java
